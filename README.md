[iDocumentation]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gphotosuploader/google-photos-api-client-go/v3

This package provides a client for using the [Google Photos API](https://developers.google.com/photos) in Go. Uses the original `photoslibrary` package, that was [provided by Google](https://code-review.googlesource.com/c/google-api-go-client/+/39951) and, now it's archived [here](https://github.com/gphotosuploader/googlemirror). 

The package offers access to these Google Photos services:
- `Albums` is a service to manage albums.
- `MediaItems` is a service to manage media items (Photos and Videos).
- `Uploader` is a service to upload items.

> This project will maintain compatibility with the last three major published [published](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html) versions of Go.

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/gphotosuploader/google-photos-api-client-go/v3
```

## Features

The package could be consumed using three different services in isolation or a `gphotos.Client`. It implements [Google Photos error handling best practices](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/best-practices#error-handling). It uses an exponential backoff policy with a maximum of 5 retries.

### Albums manager

- Consider implementing a [caching strategy](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/best-practices#caching) to avoid [Rate Limiting](#rate-limiting).
- It can be customized using `gphotos.Config.AlbumManager`.

### Media Items manager

- It can be customized using `gphotos.Config.MediaItemManager`.

### Uploader

- Offers **two uploaders** implementing the `/v1/uploads` endpoint.
  - `BasicUploader` is a simple HTTP uploader.
  - `ResumableUploader` is an uploader implementing resumable uploads. It could be used for large files, like videos. See [documentation][iDocumentation].
- It can be customized using `gphotos.Config.Uploader`.

## Authentication
The gphotos library **does not directly handle authentication**. Instead, when creating a new client, pass a `net/http.Client` that can handle authentication for you. The easiest and recommended way to do this is using the `golang.org/x/oauth2` library, but you can always use any other library that provides a `net/http.Client`.

Access to the API requires OAuth 2.0 client credentials from a Google developers project. This project must have the Library API enabled as described [here](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/get-started).

```
import (
    "golang.org/x/oauth2"

    gphotos "github.com/gphotosuploader/google-photos-api-client-go/v3"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    oc := oauth2Config := oauth2.Config{
        ClientID:     "... your application Client ID ...",
        ClientSecret: "... your application Client Secret ...",
        // ...
    }
    tc := oc.Client(ctx, "... your user Oauth Token ...")
    
    config := gphotos.Config{Client: tc}
    client := gphotos.New(config)
}
```

Note that when using an authenticated Client, all calls made by the client will include the specified OAuth 2.0 token. Therefore, authenticated clients should almost never be shared between different users.

## Limitations
Only images and videos can be uploaded. If you attempt to upload non-videos or images or formats that Google Photos doesn't understand, Google Photos will give an error when creating media item.

### Photo storage and quality
All media items uploaded to Google Photos using the API [are stored in full resolution](https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791) at original quality. **They count toward the userâ€™s storage**. The API does not offer a way to upload in "high quality" mode.

### Duplicates
If you upload the same image twice, with the same binary content, then Google Photos will deduplicate it. However, it will retain the filename from the first upload which may be confusing. In practice, this shouldn't cause too many problems.

### Albums
Note that you can only add media items that have been uploaded by this application to albums that this application has created, see [here](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/manage-albums#adding-items-to-album) why.

### Rate Limiting
Google Photos imposes a rate limit on all API clients. **The quota limit for requests to the Library API is 10,000 requests per project per day**. The quota limit for requests to access media bytes (by loading a photo or video from a base URL) is 75,000 requests per project per day.
