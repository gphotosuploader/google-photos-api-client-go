> Note: This is a major version update and is **NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE**.

```go
// New module path
import gphotos "github.com/gphotosuploader/google-photos-api-client-go/v3"
```

### Added
- `albums.PaginatedList` retrieves a specific page of albums, allowing for efficient retrieval of albums in pages. ([#65][i65])
- `media_items.PaginatedList` retrieves a specific page of media items, allowing for efficient retrieval of media items in pages. ([#65][i65])
- Possibility to set custom `BaseURL` and `UserAgent` in `albums` and `media_items` services.
- Possibility to set custom `BaseURL` in `albums` and `media_items` services using the `NewClientWithBaseURL`.
- The `MockedGooglePhotosService` implements the Google Photos API for testing purposes. 
- A new `ErrDailyQuotaExceeded` error has been implemented to detect errors when the Google Photos 'All request' daily quota has been exceeded. ([#62][i62])

### Changed
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Updated constructors for `albums.Service` and `media_items.Service` to utilize the Config struct for customizations.
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Google Photos 'All request' daily quota exceeded will not be retried. A `ErrDailyQuotaExceeded` will be raised instead. ([#62][i62])
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Uploaders have been moved to `uploader.SimpleUplader` and `uploader.ResumableUploader`.
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** The `uploader.NewResumableUploader` doesn't require a `uploader.Store` anymore. If it's not set, it will just work as an `uploader.SimpleUploader`.
- Reducing the number of retries for failed request to Google Photos API to 3,
- Simplified code in the `albums` and `media_items` modules by removing the repository abstraction, resulting in improved code readability.
- Module documentation has been improved adding examples of how to use this module.

### Fixed
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Implemented a retry policy that excludes retries when the Google Photos quota per day has been reached. Instead, it returns an error `ErrDailyQuotaExceeded`. ([#62][i62])
- Optimized the Albums Service to reduce the number of requests by fixing caching issues.
- The HTTP Client is now optional when the Album Manager, Media Item Manager, and Uploader are set.

### Removed
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Removed the previous `CachedAlbumsService` service, which was not working properly. We encourage implementing caching strategies at consumer side.
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Removed `gphotos.Client` optional options. Use `ghotos.Client` direct assignment to configure it after creation.
- All services mock in favor of the `MockedGooglePhotosService` implementing Google Photos API for testing.
- Unused OAuth scopes have been removed: `DrivePhotosReadonlyScope` and `PhotoslibrarySharingScope`.

### Changed

### Fixed
- `ListAll()` method use `excludeNonAppCreatedData` and it doesn't return all albums. ([#72][i72])
  > This could be a breaking change, given that we were excluding non app created albums previously. If you want to maintain the same behaviour as before, use `ListWithOptions()` instead.
- `MediaItems.ListByAlbum` does not support paging. ([#65][i65])
